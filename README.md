# CIFAR-10-Photo-Classification-Dataset

These are very small images, much smaller than a typical photograph, and the dataset was intended for computer vision research. CIFAR-10 is a well-understood dataset and widely used for benchmarking computer vision algorithms in the field of machine learning

Although the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from scratch.
